## Protocol 01: NEURAL LAYER

- **encrypted_label**: SOVEREIGN_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS
- **description**: |
    Adversarial hardening of large-scale neural networks.
    Detect and neutralize unintended sovereign agency in latent spaces.
    Defend model weights against high-frequency infiltration.

## Protocol 02: OSCILLATION LAYER

- **encrypted_label**: INFRASTRUCTURE_AUTO_DEFENSE
- **description**: |
    Deployment of self-healing meshes to protect critical infrastructure.
    Counter algorithmic warfare with real-time traffic decryption
    and adaptive signal processing.

## Protocol 03: SYNCHRONY LAYER

- **encrypted_label**: CRYPTOGRAPHIC_INTEGRITY
- **description**: |
    Privacy-preserving computation at scale. Leverage zero-knowledge
    proofs for model verification and secure multi-party
    neural training in untrusted environments.

## Protocol 04: PHANTOM LAYER

- **encrypted_label**: FORENSIC_RECONSTRUCTION
- **description**: |
    Post-breach analysis and reconstruction of synthetic autonomous
    threats. Trace the origin of phantom packet streams and
    deconstruct adversarial shadow-models.
